    `Hi, I'm Cody! I am currently a 2nd-year Computer Science student at the University of Washington. 
     I'm currently exploring what I am the most passionate about in the CS field and recently my friend David and I
     have been learning C++ and Unreal Engine. Along with that we co-created a YouTube channel together in hopes of
     publishing informative videos about them as well as fostering a small community that can grow alongside us as we
     learn too. Ultimately, my greatest passion is working on impactful projects that contribute to something larger 
     than myself and creating solutions people never realized they needed, yet can't live without.`
